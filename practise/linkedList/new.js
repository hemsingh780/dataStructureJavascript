-->the main difference between linked list and array array are elements and element are indexed so if i go 
to item 4 so i can do it easily with the help of index 
--> in linked list when we want to element 4 then we start with head and traversed the list then access the 
element
--> traversing through a linked kind of bit slower than arrays even through they are technically both o(n)
